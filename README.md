# Predicting-Credit-Risk

I predicted that the scaled data would offer an improvement over the unscaled data. I was right on one count, as the regression using the scaled data was an improvement over the regression that was calculated using unscaled data. There was no major difference in the random forest classification.

Unscaled Regression: .5076563164610803
Unscaled Forest: .6333475116971502

Scaled Regression: .7598894087622289
Scaled Forest: .6344108889834114
